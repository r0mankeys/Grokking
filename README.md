# Grokking

A collection of code implementations and notes from the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava.

In the book the code snippets are written in python, that is why I have one
python file.

However I wanted to practice writing code in C so I decided to write my
own implementations of the algorithms and data structures in C.

VERY GOOD CHOICE!
